# YAIM0425 d16b – Electricity without Pollution 🌱⚡

## 📦 Description

**YAIM0425 d16b – Electricity without Pollution** removes **pollution generation from all entities that use electricity**.

This MOD is designed for players who want to decouple electrical power usage from environmental impact, allowing large electric-based factories to operate without increasing pollution levels.

It is especially useful for clean-energy playstyles, testing environments, or factories focused on logistics and automation rather than combat pressure.
